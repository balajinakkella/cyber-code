//Euclidâ€™s algorithm (which considered the fastest algorithm to find gcd) is recursive, repeated replacing the bigger //integer by its remainder mod the smaller integer.
//This typically cuts one of the arguments down by about half,and so after a logarithmic number of iterations gets down to //the base case.

{
    if (y == 0)
        return x;
    else
        return gcd(y, x % y);
